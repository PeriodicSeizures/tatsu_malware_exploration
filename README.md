# Exploratory malware analysis

This is a *hopefully* in-depth analysis of a 
malware I came across.

## Overview

This malware was distributed over Discord.

At the very least it steals Discord and Gmail login tokens?

I will be attempting to reverse engineer some of this 
huge executable to find out what is exactly does. After all, 
60MB is a lot for just a token stealer.

Some questions pre-analysis:
 - How is winsock hidden?
 - What file paths are scraped?
 - Is communication encrypted during exfiltration?

Ghidra is a very awesome tool, but by the looks of
the VirusTotal lack of findings,
malware might be obfuscated. I did an earlier 
string search for 

### VirusTotal

Completely undetectable by VirusTotal! See here https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/61d27c500498ac7f9615887461fff9b348d87aff52c3e5c0e42dd72e0c4417f8/detection

Under the imports section, there is interesting findings,
such as GetProcAddress being used 
(secretly imported winsock?).
